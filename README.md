# NES-Read-netCDF

This repository contains example code used to extract northern elephant seal diving and tracking data and metadata that are stored in netCDF-4 (.nc) files. Example scripts have been written for R and Matlab. The scripts written here are not exhaustive, but meant to act as a guide for users who are unfamiliar with netCDF format files.

## Encountering Problems?
If code is not working as expected, please post an issue [here](https://github.com/rholser/NES-Read-netCDF/issues). Please provide detail about the issue - what species and instrument type are you trying to work with, and what step of the process is not working.
